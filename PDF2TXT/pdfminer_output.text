TRADEMARK AND DOMAIN NAME AGREEMENT 

This agreement (the “Agreement”) is by and between ____________________________ 

(“Party”) and Eclipse Foundation, Inc. (“Eclipse”) and is effective as of [______] [_____],  
201[__] (the “Effective Date”). 

WHEREAS, Party is the owner of certain trademarks identified in Exhibit A (the 

“Trademarks”) and of certain domain names identified in Exhibit A (the “Domain Names”); 

WHEREAS, Party is desirous of Eclipse to initiate a project or working group with a 

name based on the Trademark (the “Project Initiation”); 

WHEREAS, to accommodate the Project Initiation, Party desires to transfer all of Party’s 

rights, title and interest in and to the Trademarks to Eclipse and to thereafter have certain 
continuing usage rights of the Trademarks; 

WHEREAS, to accommodate the Project Initiation, the Parties may mutually agree to 
have any related Domain Names initially redirect to a URL designated by Eclipse and that the 
Domain Names are subsequently transferred to Eclipse; 

In consideration of the foregoing and for other good and valuable consideration, the 

receipt and sufficiency of which is hereby acknowledged, the parties agree as follows: 

1. 

Trademark Assignment.  Party irrevocably assigns, grants and transfers to 

Eclipse, all of Party’s right, title, and interest in and to the Trademarks, including all common 
law rights, and any trademark registrations and applications, along with the goodwill of the 
business symbolized by use of the Trademarks, and the right to sue third parties for and recover 
damages from future infringement of the Trademarks, the same to be held and enjoyed by 
Eclipse for its own use and enjoyment and the use and enjoyment of its successors, assigns or 
other legal representatives, as fully and entirely as the same would have been held and enjoyed 
by Party if this assignment had not been made (the “Assignment”).   

To the extent that Party is seeking to perfect the ownership of the Trademarks and 

Party’s ownership of the Trademarks has not been perfected by the Effective Date, Party agrees 
to promptly assign ownership of the Trademarks to Eclipse, in accordance with the terms of this 
Agreement, as soon as such ownership has been perfected.  Party further agrees to take all steps 
necessary to promptly expedite any perfection of their ownership in and to the Trademarks.   
Party hereby authorizes the Commissioner of Patents and Trademarks of the United States, and 
any official of any other country empowered to issue trademark registrations, to record this 
Assignment, and to issue or transfer said Trademarks to Eclipse as owner of all right, title and 
interest therein, or otherwise as Eclipse may direct, in accordance with the terms of the 
Assignment. 

2. 

Trademark Usage.  Eclipse hereby confirms that Party shall have all applicable 
rights  to use the Trademarks in accordance with the then current version of the Guidelines for 
Eclipse Logo and Trademarks currently available at:

“Trademark Guidelines”).  

3. 

Domain Names.  Upon the mutual agreement of the Parties, as of the date Eclipse 

formally approves the Project (the “Project Effective Date”), Party shall cause any related 
Domain Names (including all sub-domains and related URLs) to redirect directly to the URLs 
designated by Eclipse with no interstitial content.  Within ten (10) days of the Project Effective 
Date, Party shall transfer to Eclipse Party’s entire right, title and interest to the Domain Names.   

4. 

Execution and Delivery.  Upon Eclipse’s request, Party agrees that it will take 
such actions and execute such documents (including, without limitation, the prompt execution 
and delivery of documents in recordable form or testifying as to any material fact or thing and 
including the transfer of any domain names through appropriate communications with domain 
name registrars) as may be necessary to vest in and secure unto Eclipse the full right, title and 
interest in and to the Trademarks and Domain Names and to protect and enforce the Trademarks. 

5. 

Representations and Warranties.  Party represents and warrants that Party has the 
full right to convey the entire right, title and interest herein assigned, and that Party will not take 
any action, use any trademark or domain name, or execute any instrument or grant or transfer 
any rights, title or interests inconsistent with the rights, title and interests assigned herein. 

6. 

Warranty Disclaimer.  PARTY MAKES NO WARRANTIES, EXPRESS OR 

IMPLIED, TO ANY PERSON OR ENTITY WITH RESPECT TO THE TRADEMARKS OR 
ANY RELATED MATERIALS PROVIDED HEREUNDER, ALL OF WHICH ARE

PARTICULAR PURPOSE, TITLE AND NONINFRINGEMENT. 

7. 

Limitation of Liability.  IN NO EVENT WILL EITHER PARTY BE LIABLE 

FOR ANY SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING FROM 
OR RELATED TO THE USE OF THE TRADEMARKS, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE 
POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

Modification and Waiver.  The failure of either party to enforce its rights 
or to require performance by the other party of any term or condition of

right to require future performance of that term or condition.  Any 
amendment or modification of this Agreement or any waiver of any

constitute the entire agreement between the parties with respect to the 
subject matter hereof and supersedes all discussions, negotiations, 
agreements and past dealings, either oral or written, between or among the
